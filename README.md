# 🚀 C++ Standard Template Library (STL) 

This repository provides a comprehensive overview and practical examples of the **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**. STL is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many common data structures and algorithms.

## 📦 What is STL?

The **Standard Template Library (STL)** in C++ is divided into four main components:

### 1. ✅ Containers
Containers store and organize data efficiently.


### 2. 🔁 Iterators
Iterators act as pointers to traverse through elements of containers.



### 3. ⚙️ Algorithms
Algorithms operate on containers via iterators.

### 4. 🎯 Functors
Function objects or **functors** are objects that can be used as though they are functions.
